As of a little over two weeks ago I've stopped offering the service
I've described in `an earlier blog post`_.  Someoneâ„¢ managed maxing
out my server's resources by establishing as many connections as
possible and keeping them open for hours.  Eventually my hoster sent
me an email about unusually high resource usage.  After a reboot
everything was back to normal, but I didn't feel like allowing this to
happen again, so I shopped for a more efficient SSH honeypot.

endlessh_ fits the bill.  It does as little work as possible, yet
wastes the unsuspecting attacker's time in a rather sneaky way: By
sending an infinite SSH banner.  The downside is that you won't ever
find out what kind of software the attacker is using since it doesn't
proceed beyond that stage.  I was curious how well it works in
practice, so I collected logs for two weeks, wrote a bit less than 100
SLOC of Ruby to do basic statistics and plotted the overall
distribution with ``gnuplot``.
