((title . "About"))

It is widely known among nerds that `ninjas use Vi and pirates use
Emacs`_.  Going by that argumentation, my journey of starting with
Vim, transitioning to Emacs and sticking to Vim's keybindings clearly
has made me an Emacs ninja.

This blog will focus on wielding Emacs_ and `Emacs Lisp`_ effectively,
but also feature articles on `Arch Linux`_, `CHICKEN Scheme`_ and
other topics worth writing about.  If you're looking for something
more whimsy, give `Emacs Horrors`_ a try.
